    <p>When I was working for corporate America, I brought some Sambusas to a potluck and
        one of my senior co workers came up to me after. "Kassim, I have a business pitch for you. 
        Bring the Sambusas more often <strong>but sell it to us"</strong>
    </p>

    <p>Business was booming and I was considering getting a food truck! Sambusas are simply amazing.
        Anyone who tries them always wants more. You can fill the insides with <em>whatever you desire:</em> 
        chicken, beef, or fish. You can make it 100% vegetarian or add a vegan twist to it. So not
        only does it taste great, but it is versatile catering to anyone. <strong>This is a dish you can 
            never go wrong with.</strong>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>⅓ cup warm water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons canola oil, plus more for frying</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 large baking potato, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1 small yellow onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>1 small red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and finely diced</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Xawaash Spice Mix (<a href="https://www.splendidtable.org/story/2020/11/20/xawaash-spice-mix">recipe here</a>)</li>
        <li>½ pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the flour, water, 1 tablespoon of the oil, and a large pinch of salt in a large
            bowl and stir with a wooden spoon until a dough forms.</li> 
        <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead until it is smooth, 
            elastic, soft, and doesn’t stick to your fingers, about 5 minutes.</li> 
        <li>Return the dough to the bowl you mixed it in, lightly dust the dough with flour, and 
            cover with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap.</li> 
        <li>Set it aside to rest until soft and slightly risen, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the dough rests, place the potato and a large pinch of salt in a small saucepan
            and cover with cold water.</li>
        <li>Set the saucepan over high heat and bring the water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until the potato is tender, about 15 
            minutes, then drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, warm the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet set over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the onion, bell pepper, garlic, and Xawaash.</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion begins to soften, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and sprinkle with a large pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and stir in the potato. The whole mixture should be like a rough mash.</li>
        <li>Let the filling cool to room temperature, then season it to taste with salt.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and divide it in half.</li>
        <li>Use a floured rolling pin to roll each piece into a thin 12-inch square (or as close to
            a square as you can get).</li>
        <li>If the dough resists as you’re rolling it, just let it rest for a few minutes before 
            proceeding.</li>
        <li>Cut each square into four even strips. Divide the filling among the strips, placing it
            in a mound at one end of each strip, about 1 inch from the edge.</li>
        <li>Working with one strip at a time, fold the outer inch of the dough up and over the 
            filling to form a triangle.</li>
        <li>Take the outer end and fold it down to add another layer of dough onto the triangle.</li>
        <li>Continue folding up and down in a zigzag to continue encasing the filling in more 
            layers of dough until you reach the end of the strip.</li>
        <li>Repeat the entire process with the remaining dough and filling. You will have eight
             triangles by the time you’re done.</li>
        <li>Line a plate or tray with paper towels and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 inch of oil in a Dutch oven or other heavy pot set over medium-high heat until
            it reaches 375°F on an instant- read thermometer or until the edge of a samosa dipped
            into the oil sizzles on contact.</li>
        <li>Fry the samosas, in batches if possible, depending on the size of your pot, until 
            they are browned on all sides, about 5 minutes per samosa.</li>
        <li>Transfer the browned samosas to the prepared plate or tray to drain.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Note: Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a 
        few days and rewarmed on a baking sheet, uncovered, in a 350ºF oven for about 10 minutes 
        before serving.</p>
